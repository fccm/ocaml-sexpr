SExpr is a very simple parsing library for S-expressions.
It is released under MIT license.
Author: Florent Monnier

This version of the lib is able to parse strings between double quotes "
and end line comments starting with semicolon ;

If you don't need to parse strings (for spaces inclusion) and comments
you can use ocaml-sexpr0 instead:
